#Packer builds machine images. A machine image is a resource that stores all 
configurations, permissions, and metadata needed to create a virtual machine.

#Packer produces machine images based on written templates, and can be written
in JSON or HCL2. 

#Packer can be used to generate templates for different cloud providers as well.
There's no need to spin up a VM and make changes yourself. Describe your 
desired machine image and let Packer generate it.

#Packer fits in nicely with existing CI/CD pipelines. Use it to automatically
test new configuration management formulas or push approved builds to 
production. 

#A single Packer template can create machines images for multiple use cases, 
whether they're cross-cloud, cross-platform, or cross-environment.
