Terraform State

# Configure the Docker provider
provider "docker" {}

#Image to be used by container
resource "docker_image" "terraform-centos" {
  name         = "centos:7"
  keep_locally = true
}

# Create a container
resource "docker_container" "centos" {
  image   = docker_image.terraform-centos.latest
  name    = "terraform-centos"
  start   = true
  command = ["/bin/sleep", "500"]
}

-Terraform State matters a lot. Simply put, it maps real-world resources to 
Terraform configurations. By default, the state is stored locally in a file 
called terraform.tfstate. Prior to any modification done in the file, Terraform
refreshes the state file. Resource dependancy metadata is also tracked via the 
state file. The Terraform state file also helps to boost deployment performance
by caching resource attributes for continuous use. 

Common Terraform State commands:
terraform statelist -- list all resources tracked by the state file.
terraform state rm -- delete a resource from the state file.
terraform state show -- show details of a resource tracked in the state file.
